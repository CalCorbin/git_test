This is me testing out Cloud9 software. I don't really want to install a VirtualBox on my PC. 
Thankfully Cloud9 is such an awesome program I don't have to do that. I just work from the convenience of whatever browser I'm on from whatever computer I'm on.
Added an HTML file called index.html. This file is just for practicing HMTL tags.
