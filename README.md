# Google Homepage

This is a project where I desconsruct and reconstruct the Google Homepage. The goal of this is to have a better understanding of building an entire webpage.
UPDATE 4/30/2017- Added a second page that is the Google search results page that I desconsructed and reconstructed. Needs some tweaking but otherwise is a pretty good representation of the Google results page.

## Instructions

Open the index.html and searchresults2.html in the browser of your choice.

### Prerequisites

Runs on any modern web browser.

#### Installing

Simply download the directory to your location of choice and run the index.html file.
